## Key insights (from the dashboard)

- **Peak-share is 10.09%** of total energy use (peak window is short), but it still matters because peak pricing is higher.
- **Peak demand reached 278.6 kW**, showing short periods of high load (capacity / peak-demand risk).
- **Peak vs off-peak cost:** **€63.39K** (peak) vs **€322.67K** (off-peak). Even with a small peak-share, peak hours contribute meaningful cost due to the higher tariff.
